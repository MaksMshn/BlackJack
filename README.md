# Blackjack
A RESTful blackjack web service and a Java client.

## Setting up
The server is pakcaged as a .war file and is located in `blackjack_server/target/blackjack_server.war`. In principle it can be deployed on a standard Tomcat web server without any modifications. Afterwards you simply need to run a standalone client, found in `blackjack_client/target/blackjack_client-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` and at the login screen specify the web address of the server running the game.

To build the server or client yourself you need to point your terminal to the corresponding root directory and invoke
```bash
mvn clean
mvn package -DskipTests
```
This will re-build both java archives and place them in the previoulsy specified locations.

### Configuration
Both server and a client contain `logback.xml` file, located in `src/main/resources` directory. Using it one can configure both the level as well as the destination of log messages (by default they are printed in a console). Additionally, blackjack_server contains `config.properties` file that can be used to change security settings and adjust minimum bet.
